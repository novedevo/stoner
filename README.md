# stoner

Music production plugin that emulates Carl Stone's work on Stolen Car. Emulate is used very loosely here. You could consider this outsider art of a granular synth.

## Building

After installing [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), you can compile Stoner as follows:

```shell
cargo xtask bundle stoner --release
```
